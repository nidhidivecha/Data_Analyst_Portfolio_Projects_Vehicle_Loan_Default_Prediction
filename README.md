# Vehicle_Loan_Default_Prediction


ðŸ”¹ **About the Project**

Financial institutions face significant losses due to vehicle loan defaults, leading to increased rejection rates. This project aims to analyze a dataset with 41 attributes to determine factors affecting vehicle loan default ratios and create a predictive model.

ðŸ”¹**Key Visualizations:**

**Data Inspection:** Conducted preliminary data inspection to understand the structure of the data.

**Dealing with Missing Values:** Identified missing values, duplicates, and cleaned variable names.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Statistical Description:**
Provided statistical insights into quantitative data variables.

**Target Variable Analysis:**
Examined the distribution of the target variable (defaulters/non-defaulters).

**Categorical Variable Analysis:**
Studied target variable distribution across categories (branch, city, state, supplier, manufacturer).
Explore employment types and devise strategies to handle missing values.

**Age Analysis:**
Investigated the relationship between age and loan defaulters.

**Proof of Identity:**
Determined the most common proof of identity presented by customers.

**Credit Bureau Score Analysis:**
Studied credit bureau score distribution for defaulters vs. non-defaulters.

**Primary and Secondary Account Details:**
Explored the relationship between account details and loan default probability.

**Sanctioned vs. Disbursed Amount Analysis:**
Analyze the difference between sanctioned and disbursed amounts for primary and secondary loans.

**Enquiries and Risk:**
Investigated if customers with a higher number of enquiries are higher risk candidates.

**Credit History Analysis:**
Examined the impact of credit history on loan default probability.

**Logistic Regression Modeling:**
Performed logistic regression modeling to predict outcomes for test data.
Validated results using a confusion matrix.
